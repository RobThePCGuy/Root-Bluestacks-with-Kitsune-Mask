Thanks to [@DaRandomCube](https://github.com/DaRandomCube)'s observation, we now recommend using the actively maintained fork: [**KitsuneMagisk by 1q23lyc45**](https://github.com/1q23lyc45/KitsuneMagisk).

Check it out [BlueStacks-Root-GUI](https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/BlueStacks-Root-GUI) and please leave feedback with fixes or issues if found.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tested BlueStacks Version:**
>
> This guide is verified to work on **BlueStacks App Player `5.22.0.1102`**.  While it may work on other versions, this is the tested and recommended version for this tutorial.

> [!WARNING]
> **Understanding Magisk and BlueStacks Partitions:**
>
> Magisk, a systemless root tool, is designed for Android devices. However, BlueStacks partitions are initially read-only, preventing direct Magisk installation. This guide utilizes a simple configuration file edit (using Notepad) to temporarily enable read/write permissions, allowing Magisk (Kitsune Magisk) to be installed on the system partition.  **No external scripts or tools are required for this permission change.**

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   ‚úÖ **PC with Administrator Rights:** You'll need administrative access to modify system files.
*   ü¶ä **Kitsune Magisk APK:** Download the latest APK from the [KitsuneMagisk repository](https://github.com/1q23lyc45/KitsuneMagisk/releases) (recommended fork).
*   üîÑ **Fresh BlueStacks Installation (Recommended):**  For the most consistent results, it's advised to start with a clean installation of [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/).  This minimizes potential conflicts and ensures a smooth process.

## ‚ú® Expected Outcome

Upon successful completion of this guide, your BlueStacks instance will be fully rooted with Kitsune Magisk, granting you the ability to run applications that require root privileges.

## üìù Summary of Steps

Here's a quick overview of the rooting process.  See the "Detailed Steps" section below for a comprehensive walkthrough.

- [x] **Step 1: Modify BlueStacks Configuration:** Edit `bluestacks.conf` to enable root access.
- [x] **Step 2: Modify Instance Files:** Adjust settings in instance configuration files to allow read/write access to system partitions.
- [x] **Step 3: Install Kitsune Magisk:** Install Kitsune Magisk directly to the `/system` partition and revert configuration changes.

<summary><h2> üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Steps</h2></summary>

**Clean BlueStacks Installation is Key!**
>
> For optimal results, **[uninstall all previous BlueStacks installations](https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057724751-How-to-uninstall-BlueStacks-5-BlueStacks-X-and-BlueStacks-Services-completely-from-your-PC)** and perform a fresh install of the latest version.  This significantly reduces the chance of encountering issues during the rooting process.

**Instance Naming Convention:**
>
> This tutorial uses the following naming conventions for Master Instances:

```
Master Instances:
  - Rvc64 = Android 11
  - Pie64 = Android 9
```

**Adapt instance names according to your BlueStacks setup.**

### Step 1: Modify BlueStacks Configuration

1.  **Locate `bluestacks.conf`:** Navigate to `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\bluestacks.conf`.
2.  **Open with Notepad:** Open the `bluestacks.conf` file using your preferred text editor.
3.  **Modify Configuration Values:**
    *   Change `bst.feature.rooting="0"` to `bst.feature.rooting="1"`
    *   Change `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="0"` to `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="1"`
        *   **Note:** If you are using a different instance (e.g., Pie64), modify the corresponding `bst.instance.[InstanceName].enable_root_access` line.
4.  **Save Changes:** Save the modified `bluestacks.conf` file.

### Step 2: Modify Instance Files

1.  **Navigate to Instance Folders:** Go to `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\Engine\Rvc64\` (or your instance folder, e.g., `Pie64`).
2.  **Modify `Android.bstk.in` and `Rvc64.bstk`:** Open both `Android.bstk.in` and `Rvc64.bstk` files with Notepad (or your text editor).
3.  **Change Partition Permissions:** In both files, locate the sections for `"fastboot.vdi"` and `"Root.vhd"`.
    *   Change the line containing `"type":"Readonly"` to `"type":"Normal"` for both `"fastboot.vdi"` and `"Root.vhd"`.
    *   **Example (within the file):**
        ```diff
        -       "prop": {
        -               "type": "Readonly"
        -       },
        +       "prop": {
        +               "type": "Normal"
        +       },
        ```
4.  **Save Changes:** Save both `Android.bstk.in` and `Rvc64.bstk` files.

### Step 3: Install Kitsune Magisk

1.  **Launch BlueStacks Instance:** Start the BlueStacks instance you are rooting (e.g., Rvc64).
2.  **Install Kitsune Magisk APK:** Install the downloaded Kitsune Magisk APK within your BlueStacks instance.
3.  **Open Kitsune Magisk App:** Launch the Kitsune Magisk application.
4.  **Install Magisk (Direct Install to System):**
    *   Select the "Install" at the top under the "Magisk" field in the Kitsune Magisk app.
    *   Select the Next link to the right.
    *   **Crucially, select "Direct Install into system partition"** from the installation options. **Do not choose just "Direct Install".**

    **"Direct Install into system partition" Option Missing?**
    >
    > If you do not see the "Direct Install into system partition" option, **completely close and reopen the Kitsune Magisk app.** This usually resolves the issue.
5.  **Complete Installation and Close Emulator:** Allow Kitsune Magisk to complete the installation process. Once finished, **completely close the BlueStacks emulator.**
6.  **Revert `bluestacks.conf` Edits:**
    *   Re-open `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\bluestacks.conf` with Notepad.
    *   **Undo the changes from Step 1:**
        *   Change `bst.feature.rooting="1"` back to `bst.feature.rooting="0"`
        *   Change `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="1"` back to `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="0"`
    *   Save the modified `bluestacks.conf` file.
