> [!NOTE]
> **All-in-One Solution:**
>
> Root BlueStacks 5+ using just your *PC*, *Magisk* (Kitsune Magisk), and *Notepad*. **No external tools needed!** For a complete walkthrough, watch the video tutorial above or visit my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RobThePCGuy).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Kitsune Magisk Fork Recommended!**
>
> **January 26, 2025 Update:** Due to inactivity in the original Kitsune Mask project, users may encounter issues with newer modules. Thanks to [@DaRandomCube](https://github.com/DaRandomCube)'s observation, we now recommend using the actively maintained fork: [**KitsuneMagisk by 1q23lyc45**](https://github.com/1q23lyc45/KitsuneMagisk).

> [!NOTE]
> **BlueStacks Root GUI - New Project!**
>
> *Simplify* steps **1** and **2** below by using my Python-based *'Root'-GUI*, which allows you to toggle read/write and root permissions via a simple interface ‚Äì no file editing required! Check it out at [BlueStacks-Root-GUI](https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/BlueStacks-Root-GUI) and please leave feedback if you encounter any issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tested BlueStacks Version:**
>
> This guide is verified to work on **BlueStacks App Player `5.22.0.1102`** and supports Android 9, 11, and 13. This tutorial assumes you are using the master instance named **Rvc64** (Android 11).

> [!WARNING]
> **Understanding Magisk and BlueStacks Partitions:**
>
> Magisk is a systemless root tool designed for Android devices. However, BlueStacks partitions are initially read-only, which prevents a direct Magisk installation. This guide uses a simple configuration file edit (via Notepad) to temporarily enable read/write permissions, allowing Kitsune Magisk to be installed on the system partition. **No external scripts or tools are required for this permission change.**

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- ‚úÖ **PC with Administrator Rights:** You need administrative access to modify system files.
- ü¶ä **Kitsune Magisk APK:** Download the latest APK from the [KitsuneMagisk repository](https://github.com/1q23lyc45/KitsuneMagisk/releases) (recommended fork).
- üîÑ **Fresh BlueStacks Installation (Recommended):** For the most consistent results, start with a clean installation of [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/). This minimizes potential conflicts during the rooting process.

## ‚ú® Expected Outcome

Upon successful completion of this guide, your BlueStacks instance will be fully rooted with Kitsune Magisk, granting you the ability to run applications that require root privileges.

## üìù Summary of Steps

Here's a quick overview of the rooting process. See the "Detailed Steps" section below for a comprehensive walkthrough:

- [x] **Step 1: Modify BlueStacks Configuration:** Edit `bluestacks.conf` to enable root access.
- [x] **Step 2: Modify Instance Files:** Adjust settings in instance configuration files to allow read/write access to system partitions.
- [x] **Step 3: Install Kitsune Magisk:** Install Kitsune Magisk directly to the `/system` partition and revert configuration changes.

**Clean BlueStacks Installation is Key!**  
For optimal results, **[uninstall all previous BlueStacks installations](https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057724751-How-to-uninstall-BlueStacks-5-BlueStacks-X-and-BlueStacks-Services-completely-from-your-PC)** and perform a fresh install of the latest version. This greatly reduces the chance of encountering issues during the rooting process.

**Instance Naming Convention:**  
This tutorial uses the following naming conventions for master instances:

```
Master Instances:
  - Tiramisu64 = Android 13 (beta)
  - Rvc64 = Android 11
  - Pie64    = Android 9
```

*Adapt the instance names according to your BlueStacks setup.*

### Step 1: Modify BlueStacks Configuration

1. **Locate `bluestacks.conf`:**  
   Navigate to `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt`.

2. **Open with Notepad:**  
   Open the `bluestacks.conf` file using your preferred text editor.

3. **Modify Configuration Values:**
   - Change `bst.feature.rooting="0"` to `bst.feature.rooting="1"`.
   - Change `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="0"` to `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="1"`.
   - **Note:** If you are using a different instance (e.g., Pie64 or Tiramisu64), modify the corresponding `bst.instance.[InstanceName].enable_root_access` line.

4. **Save Changes:**  
   Save the modified `bluestacks.conf` file.

### Step 2: Modify Instance Files

1. **Navigate to the Master Instance Folder:**  
   Go to `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\Engine\Rvc64` (or your instance folder, e.g., `Pie64` or `Tiramisu64`).

2. **Modify `Android.bstk.in`:**
   - Open the `Android.bstk.in` file with Notepad (or your text editor).
   - **Change Partition Permissions:**  
     For the `location="fastboot.vdi"` and `location="Root.vhd"` entries, change the attribute from `type="Readonly"` to `type="Normal"`.
   - **Example:**
     ```diff
     -       location="fastboot.vdi" format="VDI" type="Readonly" />
     -       location="Root.vhd" format="VHD" type="Readonly"/>
     
     +       location="fastboot.vdi" format="VDI" type="Normal" />
     +       location="Root.vhd" format="VHD" type="Normal"/>
     ```
   - Save the file.

3. **Modify `Rvc64.bstk`:**
   - If you haven‚Äôt created clones, this file will be located in the master instance folder (`C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\Engine\Rvc64`).
   - **For Cloned Instances:**  
     If you have cloned (or copied) the master instance, the folder and file might be named something like `Rvc64_1`. In this case, replace the instance name in the instructions accordingly.
   - **Note on Clones:**  
     Clones do not include a separate copy of the `[InstanceName].bstk` file; it is saved within the clone‚Äôs folder in the Engine directory. Similarly, clones do not make a copy of the master‚Äôs `Android.bstk.in` file‚Äîit remains in the master instance folder.
   - Open `Rvc64.bstk` with Notepad.
   - **Change Partition Permissions:**  
     For the `location="fastboot.vdi"` and `location="Root.vhd"` entries, change `type="Readonly"` to `type="Normal"`.
   - **Example:**
     ```diff
     -       location="fastboot.vdi" format="VDI" type="Readonly" />
     -       location="Root.vhd" format="VHD" type="Readonly"/>
     
     +       location="fastboot.vdi" format="VDI" type="Normal" />
     +       location="Root.vhd" format="VHD" type="Normal"/>
     ```
   - Save the file.

### Step 3: Install Kitsune Magisk

1. **Launch BlueStacks Instance:**  
   Start the BlueStacks instance you wish to root (e.g., Rvc64).

2. **Install Kitsune Magisk APK:**  
   Install the downloaded Kitsune Magisk APK within your BlueStacks instance.

3. **Open Kitsune Magisk App:**  
   Launch the Kitsune Magisk application.

4. **Install Magisk (Direct Install to System Partition):**
   - Select the "Install" option at the top under the "Magisk" field.
   - Tap the Next link to proceed.
   - **Crucially, select "Direct Install into system partition"** from the available installation options. **Do not choose just "Direct Install".**

   > **If the "Direct Install into system partition" option is missing:**  
   > Completely close and reopen the Kitsune Magisk app. This usually resolves the issue.

5. **Complete Installation and Close Emulator:**  
   Allow Kitsune Magisk to finish installing. Once done, **completely close the BlueStacks emulator.**

6. **Revert `bluestacks.conf` Edits:**
   - Re-open `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\bluestacks.conf` with Notepad.
   - **Undo the changes from Step 1:**
     - The `bst.feature.rooting` value should revert automatically to `"0"`.
     - Change `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="1"` back to `bst.instance.Rvc64.enable_root_access="0"` (or the corresponding line for your instance, e.g., Pie64 or Tiramisu64).
   - Save the file.
